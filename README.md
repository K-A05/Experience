## Previous projects
### **Browser based Game application:**
Made with a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript libraries like [[https://p5js.org/]]{p5.js}, it uses clever tricks to animate the character in various orientations and runs ubiquitously on any browser.

### **Browser Based drawing application**
Using many of the same libraires used in the browser based game, I made a clone inspired by [[Micro Soft Paint]][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint], that has implemented varioud different tools such as a bucket tool, an eraser with a variable radius, functionality to pick any color, a symmetry functionality to mirror the left and right side of the canvas, a spray tool with variable radius and density.

### XOR cipher
Implemented a XOR cipher in C, which scans the current directory for a clear.txt file and uses the /dev/urandom directory to generate a key with which it encrypts the clear.txt file, outputing a key.txt file and a cipher.txt file. The programme can then be run with the '-d' flag to run it in decryption mode which will output a "decrypted.txt" file that will have the same contents as the "clear.txt" file.

### Current work 
#### Plant Identification AI: an upcoming project that will make use of a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a data set of plant images to allow users to identify plants in the environment by scanning them with their camera or uploading a photo.

#### HTTP Proxy in Rust:
A custom written proxy in Rust that is able to intercept traffic to and from a client device and annonymise their IP address on the internet to enhance the security posture and privacy of the user.

### Additional Qualification
#### Google IT Support:
