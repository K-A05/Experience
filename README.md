# Experience
A repository to show display my capabilities as a programmer.

## Previous projects
### **Browser based Game application:**
Made with a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript libraries like [[https://p5js.org/]][p5.js], it uses clever tricks to animate the character in various orientations and runs ubiquitously on any browser.

### **Browser Based drawing application**
Using many of the same libraires used in the browser based game, I made a clone inspired by [[Micro Soft Paint]][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint], that has implemented varioud different tools such as a bucket tool, an eraser with a variable radius, functionality to pick any color, a symmetry functionality to mirror the left and right side of the canvas, a spray tool with variable radius and density.
